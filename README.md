<div class="text-justify "   >
<p>PicoDico is an online open source dictionary based on pictures. The PicoDico&rsquo;s goal is to become &ldquo;the largest multi-language pictorial dictionary in the word&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When you type a word in PicoDico and click on search button, PicoDico presents 32 related images of the word. PicoDico gets these images from Google. In fact, PicoDico presents the first 32 images of the word, if you search it on Google Images.</p>
<p>PicoDico works in any languages, for example PicoDico will show pictures of fish if you submit the word &ldquo;<a href="http://picodico.com/?q=fish">fish</a>&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;<a href="http://picodico.com/?q=%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%87%DB%8C">ماهی</a>&rdquo; which means fish in Persian language.</p>
<p>This dictionary is not reliable at all. In some words it shows wrong image or images. You can improve the PicoDico with approve the correct image by clicking on &ldquo;Yes, this is OK&rdquo;. Actually you can trust the images at &ldquo;Approved by users&rdquo; section. But as you know, these images approved by users and maybe, it shows the wrong picture sometime.</p>
